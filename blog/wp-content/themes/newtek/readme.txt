Theme Features
==============

Light design with a simplistic layout.

Featured image – 640 x 360 centered image. Great for photos or posters. The first post with a featured image will display
in full size, and the rest of featured images will be thumbnail sizes. This differentiates the top post on main page.

Custom Logo option – Theme supports the upload of a custom logo to replace the default site text and description. Suggested dimensions are 300 x 50.

Custom Background option – Theme supports background color changes and a background image. Outside the wrapper, the colors can be changed using the color picker in the ‘Customize’ area. A background image can also be uploaded which can be fixed or scroll-able.

Custom Font – Thanks to the availability of free fonts, this theme features a neat custom font for all the text.

Footer widgets - Add 3 sets of widgets at the bottom of the page.

Return to top link in the footer.


Installation
============

2. upload newtek folder to 'wp-content/themes/' directory

Notes
=====

- Using basic blog functions, theme can be W3C validated in HTML5. Plugins and galleries may create some W3C errors.
CSS is already W3C validated.

- To change background or to add a logo, go to the Dashboard -> Appearance.

- Make sure to set a navigation menu after installation.

- For featured images in existing posts, you may have to download the 'Regenerate Thumbnails' plugin from WordPress.org, then run it to resize all existing thumbnails to the theme's default sizes.

- Youtube frames will be resized in widgets area however height will be set to auto. You will have to set height manually when pasting the embed code in text area e.g. height="150".  The same applies to large images as well.
